The purpose of this Python programme is to meet the needs of computer science students at the IGCSE and AS levels, especially those who need a platform for implementing pseudocode. Pseudocode is not supported by traditional IDEs, hence students are not able to complete their tasks in an ideal setting. Thus, the goal of this programme is to offer a fundamental interface that includes all of the features that are required for thinking and coding according to the AS and IGCSE level syllabus standards. I hope this worksðŸ˜˜

1. BuiltInFunction Class

Description:
This class represents a collection of built-in functions typically found in programming languages. It provides methods to check the validity of function parameters and to execute each function.

Sample Usage
```python
# Create an instance of BuiltInFunction
builtin_functions = BuiltInFunction()

# Call the CHR function
chr_value = builtin_functions.CHR([65])
print(chr_value)  # Output: A

# Call the LENGTH function
length_value = builtin_functions.LENGTH(["Hello"])
print(length_value)  # Output: 5
```

2. Error Class

Description:
The Error class provides methods to raise different types of errors encountered during lexical analysis, interpretation, or syntax analysis. Each method raises a specific type of error with a descriptive message.

Sample Usage:
```python
# Create an instance of Error
error_handler = Error()

# Raise a syntax error
error_handler.syntax_error(';', 10)
# This would raise: SyntaxError: Unexpected ; at line 10
```

3. Token Class

Description:
The Token class represents a lexical token identified during the lexical analysis phase of compilation. It stores information about the type and value of the token.

Sample Usage:
```python
# Create a Token instance
token = Token('KEYWORD', 'IF')

# Access token properties
print(token.type)   # Output: KEYWORD
print(token.value)  # Output: IF
```

4. Lexer Class

Description:
The Lexer class is responsible for tokenizing source code. It reads the input code character by character, identifies tokens based on predefined rules, and categorizes them accordingly.

Sample Usage:
```python
# Create a Lexer instance with code
lexer = Lexer("IF x > 5 THEN PRINT 'Hello' ENDIF")

# Get tokens from the lexer
while True:
    token = lexer.next_token()
    if token.type == 'EOF':
        break
    print(token.type, token.value)
```

These descriptions and sample usages demonstrate the functionality and usage of each class in your Python programs.
