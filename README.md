Pseudotranslate.Alevel-
This program can be a valuable tool for IGCSE AS/A level students learning about programming. By providing a safe and interactive environment to write and test pseudocode, it can help them grasp the logic behind coding concepts and identify errors in their code.
i hope this works

Sure, let's provide descriptions and some sample usage for the Python programs you provided:

1. BuiltInFunction Class

Description:
This class represents a collection of built-in functions typically found in programming languages. It provides methods to check the validity of function parameters and to execute each function.

Sample Usage
```python
# Create an instance of BuiltInFunction
builtin_functions = BuiltInFunction()

# Call the CHR function
chr_value = builtin_functions.CHR([65])
print(chr_value)  # Output: A

# Call the LENGTH function
length_value = builtin_functions.LENGTH(["Hello"])
print(length_value)  # Output: 5
```

2. Error Class

Description:
The Error class provides methods to raise different types of errors encountered during lexical analysis, interpretation, or syntax analysis. Each method raises a specific type of error with a descriptive message.

Sample Usage:
```python
# Create an instance of Error
error_handler = Error()

# Raise a syntax error
error_handler.syntax_error(';', 10)
# This would raise: SyntaxError: Unexpected ; at line 10
```

3. Token Class

Description:
The Token class represents a lexical token identified during the lexical analysis phase of compilation. It stores information about the type and value of the token.

Sample Usage:
```python
# Create a Token instance
token = Token('KEYWORD', 'IF')

# Access token properties
print(token.type)   # Output: KEYWORD
print(token.value)  # Output: IF
```

4. Lexer Class

Description:
The Lexer class is responsible for tokenizing source code. It reads the input code character by character, identifies tokens based on predefined rules, and categorizes them accordingly.

Sample Usage:
```python
# Create a Lexer instance with code
lexer = Lexer("IF x > 5 THEN PRINT 'Hello' ENDIF")

# Get tokens from the lexer
while True:
    token = lexer.next_token()
    if token.type == 'EOF':
        break
    print(token.type, token.value)
```

These descriptions and sample usages demonstrate the functionality and usage of each class in your Python programs.
